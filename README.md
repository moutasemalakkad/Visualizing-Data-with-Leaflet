# Visualizing-Data-with-Leaflet

## Visualize Global Earthquake Data
In this project, I have visualized earthquakes occurring globally using a live API feed provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The data in the feed is updated every 5 mins, and includes all earthquake data for the Past 7 Days. I have also included an additional layer of tectonic plates to understand the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.


# Technology stack used in developing this web application is as follows:
1. leaflet.js
1. HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript
1. GeoJSON


# Data Sources used :

1. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
